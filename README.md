# Flutter Color Game
This is a simple Flutter project that showcases basic state management, UI separation from business logic, and animation effects. The app demonstrates how to change background colors randomly and includes two interactive features

### Tap to Change Color:
You can tap anywhere on the screen, and the background color will change to a randoly generated color
### Shuffle Colors:
Press the button at the bottom right of the screen to start a color shuffle animation. The background color changes rapidly

# Project Structure
 - ColorController: Manage the color generation and the shuffle effect using ValueNotifier to notify UI of state changes.
 - UI Layer: Displays color changes and react to user inputs.
